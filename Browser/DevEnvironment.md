# Development Environment

In order to upload an immortal website or dApp it is more efficient to upload the whole application in one file and with a minimum number of bytes. [This environment](https://github.com/SavAct/SavWeb/tree/main/Dev%20Page) is a template which fulfils this requirement in an optimal way.

It uses TypeScript for type safety. Vite and Quasar with Vue 3 are used for a fast development process. The resulting file size is reduced by using the publicly hosted libraries of Quasar and Vue.
