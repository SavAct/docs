# Downloading a File from the Blockchain

## Directly Through the Address Bar

1. Open the [SavAct Browser](https://savact.app/#/_browser_).
2. Enter the address of the file; refer to the [naming scheme](/Browser/NamingScheme).

## Within a Decentralized Website

A file on the blockchain could be an HTML file with JavaScript, which will be displayed as a website.
This website operates within an [iframe](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.ASP) and can interact with the SavWeb browser via [PostMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage). To enable this interaction, it needs to exchange an identification token first; refer to the [Browser Requests](BrowserRequests.md) section for further details.
